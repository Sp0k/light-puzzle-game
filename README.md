# Turn it off
This is a small puzzle game based on those light enigmas where the player starts
with a set of lights and some of them are lit up. The goal for each puzzle is to
turn off every light. When the player presses on a light, they toggle it, and the
light's neighbours. Hence the challenge.


## How to play
Playing this game is really simple, all a player requires is the use of the mouse
and that's it.

Relax, sit back and enjoy the levels and the music (once the game will be released).

## Gallery
There is temporarily no images available of the game since the development hasn't been
going on for long enough.

## Technical
The game is being developed using Unity 2022.3.19f1, which is the latest version released
at the beginning of the development.

The game is programmed in C# using a 3D environment but 2D sprites.

## Why this project?
I had the idea for this project thanks to my Linear Algrebra and Matrix Theory class. In
one of the assignments, I had to solve a puzzle like this, and I thought it could not be
too hard to program, so I tried it and here we are.

I also wanted to add more finished and polished game to my portfolio. Especially games
that are playable since I lost so many of my really old games.

Overall, I recommend trying to do this project yourself if you are curious, it is really fun.
